# Classification-and-Vector-Spaces-in-NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) uses algorithms to understand and manipulate human language. This technology is one of the most broadly applied areas of machine learning. As AI continues to expand, so will the demand for professionals skilled at building models that analyze speech and language,  uncover contextual patterns, and produce insights from text and audio. During this project I design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis,  create tools to translate languages and summarize text  Classification and Vector Spaces in NLP This is the first course of the Natural Language Processing Specialization.  1: Logistic Regression for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Use a simple method to classify positive or negative sentiment in tweets  2: Na√Øve Bayes for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Use a more advanced model for sentiment analysis  3: Vector Space Models Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce  the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships  4: Word Embeddings and Locality Sensitive Hashing for Machine Translation Write a simple English-to-French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate  words via approximate k-nearest neighbors search
